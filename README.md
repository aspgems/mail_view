MailView -- Visual email testing
================================

Preview plain text and html mail templates in your browser without redelivering it every time you make a change.

This fork
---------

If you have several mailer classes you needed to write those classes inside the routes.rb, but with this fork you don't
 need to write them the library do it for you (We save the classes that are descendant of MailView)

Installation
------------

Install as a plugin:

Rails 3

```shell
rails plugin install git://github.com/aspgems/mail_view.git
```

Rails 2

```shell
script/plugin install git://github.com/aspgems/mail_view.git
```

or add the following line to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tilt'
```
and run `bundle install` from your shell.


Usage
-----

Since most emails do something interesting with database data, you'll need to write some scenarios to load messages with fake data. Its similar to writing mailer unit tests but you see a visual representation of the output instead.

```ruby
    class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
      def invitation(inviter, invitee)
        # ...
      end

      def welcome(user)
        # ...
      end

      class Preview < MailView
        # Pull data from existing fixtures
        def invitation
          account = Account.first
          inviter, invitee = account.users[0, 2]
          Notifier.invitation(inviter, invitee)
        end

        # Factory-like pattern
        def welcome
          user = User.create!
          mail = Notifier.welcome(user)
          user.destory
          mail
        end
      end
    end
```

Methods must return a [Mail][1] or [TMail][2] object. Using ActionMailer, call `Notifier.create_action_name(args)` to return a compatible TMail object. Now on ActionMailer 3.x, `Notifier.action_name(args)` will return a Mail object.

Routing
-------

A mini router middleware is bundled for Rails 2.x support.

```ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb
    config.middleware.use MailView::Mapper
```

For RailsÂ³ you can map the app inline in your routes config.

```ruby
    # config/routes.rb
    mount MailView => 'mail_view' if Rails.env.development?
```

Now just load up `http://localhost:3000/mail_view`.
